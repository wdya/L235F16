    This is a picture of me. My name is Trista. I am six years old, and I love to sleep!<br><br>
    I've been coding since I was three years old. I love making webpages. I'm the savviest pug around!<br>

    I'm the adorable face behind many of your favorite places to visit online. I coded Facebook, CNN, eBay, and Education Connection! No one seems to know all the contributions I've made, but that's okay. I can be the pug behind the curtain. It's nice back here. I can't wait for you to see what I have next in store!<br>
