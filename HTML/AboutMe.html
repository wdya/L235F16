      <p>I'm Lindsey. I'm so excited to flesh out this site and continue work on this project!</p>
      <p>Just beginning my first semester at college, I'm learning a lot and changing even more, learning about myself and my interests. I love<img src="/L235F16/images/nms1.jpg" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="12" width="500" alt="No Man's Sky artwork"> coding and electronic sciences, as well as calculus and hard sciences, written arts and literature, and music and the arts. Passionate about social justice and human rights, I devote myself above all to learning about people and how to use my various social positions for good. In all these interests I see common threads of rules vs. patterns, nature vs. nurture, fluidity vs. restriction. I thrive off these opposing forces.</p>
      <p>I've lived my entire life in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in a moderate town of the suburbs of Philadelphia. My sister now lives and attends graduate school in Santa Fe, New Mexico, so I live only with my mother and dog. I attended Pennsbury High School, a public school roughly twice the size of Bard, with two buildings and well over a hundred teachers who largely have never heard of each other. This background has made me entirely used to not recognizing most of the faces around me (I scarcely recognized a third of the names read out at my graduation), which has helped me get accustomed to life in a new setting.</p>
      <p>I took a class on web programming and HTML in my freshman year of high school, and though I may have forgotten much of the details of HTML, I found a love for constructing pages and layering code; I can't wait to relearn much of it in this project!</p>
      <p>Also, I love dogs. A lot. Here's a picture of my own dog to wrap up:</p>
