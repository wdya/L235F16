      I'm Lindsey. I'm so excited to flesh out this site and continue work on this project!<br><br>
      Just beginning my first semester at Bard College, I'm learning a lot and changing even more, learning about myself and my interests. I love<img src="/L235F16/images/nms1.jpg" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="12" width="500"> coding and electronic sciences, as well as calculus and hard sciences, written arts and literature, and music and the arts. Passionate about social justice and human rights, I devote myself above all to learning about people and how to use my various social positions for good. In all these interests I see common threads of rules vs. patterns, nature vs. nurture, fluidity vs. restriction. I thrive off these opposing forces.
